"""Message definitions for TUI inter-widget communication.

This module defines the messages that flow between widgets following
Textual's message bubbling pattern. Messages bubble up the DOM tree
from child to parent, allowing ancestor widgets to handle them.

Message Flow:
    InputField
        ↓
    InputAreaContainer ← Handles SlashCommandSubmitted (routes to ConversationManager)
        ↓
    ConversationManager ← Handles UserInputSubmitted (renders and processes)
        ↓
    OpenHandsApp       ← Handles app-level concerns (modals, notifications)
